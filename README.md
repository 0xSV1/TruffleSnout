> Despite their reputation, pigs are not dirty animals. They’re actually quite clean. The pig’s reputation as a filthy animal comes from its habit of rolling in mud to cool off. 

We call it _OpSec_.

> Pigs have poor eyesight,but a great sense of smell. The pig uses the snout to search, or root, for food. 

We call it _targeted enumeration_.

> Pigs are among the smartest of all domesticated animals and are even smarter than dogs.

We call it _situational awareness_.
